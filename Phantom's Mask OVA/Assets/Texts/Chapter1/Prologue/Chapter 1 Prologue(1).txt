*Vrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm*
(The sound of the car puts me at ease. I don't know why Christopher wants to have his birthday party at a creepy abandoned amusement park, but this is our last chance to hang out before school starts again.)
Yvette: "Hey you ok back there girl? You look like you're spacing out."
Robbie: "You need us to stop the car, Caroline?"
Caroline: "Huh? Oh, no I'm fine. Just thinking."
Yvette: "You're always like that. Say something every now and again so we know you're still alive back there."
Caroline: "Will do."
Caroline: (The girl driving is Yvette. I've been friends with her since middle school. She's a bit intimidating, but deep down she's a really sweet girl.)
Caroline: (The boy on the passenger side is Robbie, Yvette's brother. He's super into computers, and he runs a DND group for our group of friends. He's become the infamous mediator between us whenever we argue with each other.)
Robbie: "Hey we're getting close! Look, there's the old billboard for Wonder World!"
Caroline: (Wonder World. The amusement park that was abandoned as quickly as it opened. For a while, the park was booming; but multiple fires, attraction breakdowns, and a general string of bad luck forced the owner, Edward Briggs to close the doors. 
That being said, the billboard still seems to be in pretty good...)
