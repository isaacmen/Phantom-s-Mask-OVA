*Vrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm*
(The sound of the car puts me at ease. I don't know why Brian wants to have his birthday party at a creepy abandoned amusement park, but this is our last chance to hang out before school starts again.)
Yvette: “Hey you ok back there girl? You look like you're spacing out.”
Robbie: “You need us to stop the car, Caroline?”
Caroline: “Huh? Oh, no I'm fine. Just thinking.”
Yvette: “You're always like that. Say something every now and again so we know you're still alive back there.”
Caroline: “Will do.”
(The girl driving is Yvette. I've been friends with her since middle school. She's a bit intimidating, but deep down she's a really sweet girl.)
(The boy on the passenger side is Robbie, Yvette's brother. He's super into computers, and he runs a DND group for our group of friends. He's become the infamous mediator between us whenever we argue with each other.)
Robbie: “Hey we're getting close! Look, there’s the old billboard for Wonder World!”
(Wonder World. The amusement park that was abandoned as quickly as it opened. For a while, the park was booming; but multiple fires, attraction breakdowns, and a general string of bad luck forced the owner, Edward Briggs to close the doors.
That being said, the billboard still seems to be in pretty good…)
(!!!!)
Caroline: “Did you guys just see somebody fall off the billboard?!”
Yvette: “I think you're hallucinating girl. Probably just a piece of the old thing breaking off.”
Robbie: “Yeah! I mean the park's been closed for ages! I'm sure nothing bad will-
*puttttt……..wheeze….*
Robbie: “Woah, did we hit something? Why'd the car stop?”
Yvette: “No, I think it just broke down. This car is pretty old.”
Caroline: “Guess we better take a look at the car.”
