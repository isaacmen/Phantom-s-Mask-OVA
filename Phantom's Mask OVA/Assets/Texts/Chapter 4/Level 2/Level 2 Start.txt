Caroline: "Hey Veronica, is there a rope or something you can use to climb up here?"
Veronica: "Yeah, grab this!"
Caroline: "Alright I got it! W-wait no I don't!"
Robbie: "Caroline!"
*THUD*
Caroline: "...oops."
Veronica: "Alright, well let's keep looking for a way out then. I found a kitchen knife lying around earlier. I knew those knife defense classes I took would be worth it!"
Hey, I see you met up with Veronica! Her ability is cut, which lets you use dull kitchen knives to cut through certain objects or pry things open. Give it a try!
