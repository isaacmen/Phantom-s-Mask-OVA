Caroline: "No kidding. Do you think the ghost of Edward Briggs is haunting us?"
Veronica: "It's just a silly ghost story. Who'd ever believe that?"
*SMASH*
Veronica: "W-what was that?"
Robbie: "Guess our ghost friend wants us gone."
Veronica: "Y-yeah r-right. Ghosts don't exist Robbie."
*SMASH*
Veronica: "EEEEEEE It's getting closer! Spare me please?"
Caroline: "...Not afraid of ghosts huh?"
Robbie: "Whatever it is, get ready!"
*SMASH*
Yvette: "Hey! Look who it is!"
Christopher: "Do you know how long we've been looking for you?"
Veronica: "......"
Yvette: "What's wrong Veronica? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Christopher: "Yeah, what about it?"

Christopher: "Oh no you don't. You're coming with us."
Robbie: "Oh? Is someone scared of ghosts?"
Veronica: "Shut up, Robbie."
Yvette: "Haunted house it is! Let's get to it!"
