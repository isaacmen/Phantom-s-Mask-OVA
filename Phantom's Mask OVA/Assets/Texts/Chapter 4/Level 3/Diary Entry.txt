Park sales just keep dropping. This place used to be my dream come true, and now it's just one misfortune after another.
I think this is the end for Wonder World, and it might be the end for me as well.
If I'd rather die before I saw this park go bankrupt. Maybe if I bury myself at the haunted house I'll somehow revive as a phantom and protect the park.
Ha, like that'd ever happen.
