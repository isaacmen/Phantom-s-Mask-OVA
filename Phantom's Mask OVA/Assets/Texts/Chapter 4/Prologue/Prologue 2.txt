Caroline: "Robbie! Are you ok?"
Robbie: "..Caroline? Where are we? Weren't you with the others at the rollercoaster?"
Caroline: "Yeah, but the building collapsed, and when I woke up, I was here."
Caroline: "This is.. a diner?"
*RATTLE* *CLANG*
Robbie: "Yeah and haunted by the looks of it. Quick, let's run before anything else happens!"
???: "HEEEEYYY! Let me outta here! This isn't funny Christopher! Guys? Anyone?!"
Caroline: "Isn't that Veronica?"
Caroline: (Veronica is the school's student council president. She's pretty attentive about small details, and likes to pick up random skills on a whim.)
Robbie: "Hey prez, you in there?"
Veronica: "Robbie? Get me outta here! Just because I passed out does not give you permission to lock me in a diner!"
Caroline: "It wasn't us, promise! Let me explain what's going on."
...
Veronica: "Ok, I think I got it. If it was anyone else I'd write it off, but you don't usually joke about stuff like this Caroline."
Veronica: "All I remember is partying for a little while, then I woke up here a little while later. If there really is wierd stuff going on around here, I'm sure there's a way to get me out."
Veronica: "You guys try to open the door from the outside. I'll take another look around in here."
