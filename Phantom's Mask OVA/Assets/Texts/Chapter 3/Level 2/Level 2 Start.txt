Yvette: “Christopher! Veronica!”
Brian: “Woah, right on the money Yvette! But why aren't they waking up?”
(Everybody likes Christopher. He’s generally a likeable guy, willing to help us out on a moments notice.)
(Veronica is our student council president. She's always super organized and tends to notice little details we usually miss.)
Caroline: “You didn't either until we touched that ball of light. Maybe we should try to hit them with something.”
Yvette: “Well, they're in line with the tracks. Why don’t we just send the coaster carts at them?”
Caroline: “You know, that might not-”
Brian: “Now that’s an idea I can get behind! So what's the plan Yvette?”
Caroline: “I really don’t think-”
Yvette: “I bet if we crank up the electricity and wait for Robbie to get the power back on, the surge will send the cars flying!”
Brian: “AWESOME! Hey Caroline, stop standing there and come help us out!”
Caroline: “...I guess I'll call Robbie and tell him to hold off for a bit.”
