Yvette: "Veronica!"
Christopher: "Woah, right on the money Yvette! But why isn't she waking up?"
(Veronica is our student council president. She's always super organized and tends to notice little details we usually miss.)
(She's kinda paranoid too. I think she's practiced self-defense with knives or something weird like that.)
Caroline: "You didn't either until we touched that ball of light. Maybe we should try to hit them with something."
Yvette: "Well, they're in line with the tracks. Why don't we just send the coaster carts at them?"
Caroline: "You know, that might not..."
Christopher: "Now that's an idea I can get behind! So what's the plan Yvette?"
Caroline: "I really don’t think..."
Yvette: "I bet if we crank up the electricity and wait for Robbie to get the power back on, the surge will send the cars flying!"
Christopher: "AWESOME! Hey Caroline, stop standing there and come help us out!"
Caroline: "...I guess I'll call Robbie and tell him to hold off for a bit."
