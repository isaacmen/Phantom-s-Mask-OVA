Christopher: "Best. Birthday. EVER! That was awesome! Let’s bring these guys back to the employee lounge."

Caroline: "And this is why you guys don’t shout like lunatics."
Yvette: "What, you think the building is actually gonna fall? You can't just make earthquakes happen."

Caroline: "WAIT, WHAT?"
Everyone: "AAAHHHHHHHHH!"
