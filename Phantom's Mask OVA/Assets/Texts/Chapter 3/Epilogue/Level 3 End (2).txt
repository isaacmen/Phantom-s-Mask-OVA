Yvette: "Come on girl, have some fun every once and awhile! Wasn't that awesome!?"
Caroline: "Fine, I’ll admit, that was pretty cool. Look at the carts go!"
Christopher: "Best. Birthday. EVER! That was awesome! Let’s bring these guys back to the employee lounge."
???: "As your thunder wave sends the cart flying, the building collapses. Rocks fall, everyone dies."
Yvette: "Wow, salty dungeon master. Wait, who was that?"
Caroline: "Good question. You know, this is why you guys don’t shout like lunatics."
Yvette: "What, you think the building is actually gonna fall? You can't just make earthquakes happen."
Christopher: "Yeah, loosen up Caroline. Last time I heard that voice was right before I blacked out. I'm sure it’s fine."
Caroline: "Oh, ok then."
...
Caroline: "WAIT, WHAT?"
Everyone: "AAAHHHHHHHHH!"
