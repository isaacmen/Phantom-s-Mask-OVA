I'm not selling this land. After all I've been through, I refuse to abandon my final hope.
I'll protect this land till the day I die.
If I'm lucky, I'll protect it in death. Nobody will know where I'll die, and nobody will tear this place down.
My dream will never die.
All I wanted was for somebody to support me.
Caroline: "..."
Christopher: "What a rough life. I feel sorry for him."
Yvette: "Do you think he committed suicide?"
Veronica: "Sounds likely. Poor guy. He just needed a good friend."
