My wife divorced me today. Everything is falling apart.
My daughter is dead. My extended family won't even talk to me.
All I have left is this park, and soon that will leave me to.
Am I just a failure?
Caroline: "..."
Veronica: "It was just one tragedy after another with this guy."
Robbie: "I can't even imagine what he was going through."
