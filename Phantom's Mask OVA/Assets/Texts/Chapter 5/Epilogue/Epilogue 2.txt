Veronica: "EYAAHHH!"
Yvette: "Veronica what's-"
Caroline: "...That's him right?"
Robbie: "Yeah, I think so. Looks like there's one more note for us."
To whoever is reading this,
First of all, congratulations for finding my secret room. I hid it behind a lot of contraptions in the haunted house, so nobody ever found me.
Now let's get to the rest of it. I know it's selfish, but please bury my body. Of all the decisions I've made in my life, this is my biggest regret.
I thought I would be happy if I just disappeared from society altogether. Did you know that humans are social creatures?
All I wanted was a happy family life. I once thought Wonder World invincible, but now I just feel like I let my daughter down.
I can't even feel sorry for myself at this point. All I can do now is hope that someone can help me amend my poor decisions.
So once again I will ask, please bury me. My biggest regret is abandoning myself.
Thank you for your help, Edward Briggs.
Caroline: *sniffle* "This is just too much. This poor man lost his dreams so quickly that the only thing he could do was die."
Christopher: "Seesh. What a terrible life. It sounds like something straight out of a supernatural mystery game."
Veronica: "The least we can do is honor him right?"
Caroline: "Yeah, let's bury him in the graveyard by the haunted house. I think I saw some tools in the shed."
