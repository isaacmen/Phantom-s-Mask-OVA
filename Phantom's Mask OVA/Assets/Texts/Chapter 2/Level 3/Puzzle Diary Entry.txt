Diary entry:
Today marks the the 20th anniversary of the park! I'm feeling nostalgic, so I'm going to write a recap of all our historical events at the park.
1893: Wonder World opened
1896: Roller coaster opens
1900: Haunted house opens, with smaller similar attractions like the hall of mirrors opening soon after
1907: Ferris Wheel opens
