Yvette: "Wow. An abandoned ferris wheel. Great."
Robbie: "Thanks captain obvious. Looks like nobody's here."
Yvette: "Excuse me?! What did you just say?"
Robbie: "W-Wait! Kidding, kidding!"
(That's strange. Somebody left that note clearly intending for somebody to find it, so why is this place deserted?)
???: "................................h...elp......h..elp...."
(!!!)
Caroline: "Hey guys, be quiet for a moment."
Yvette: "Huh? What's wrong, caroline?"
???: ".........help..."
Caroline: "There! Did you hear that?"
Robbie: "That sounds like it came from the top of the ferris wheel."
Yvette: "Is that… it is! That's Brian up there!"
Caroline: (Brian, the party host of the year. He's the school's best linebacker with a sense for adventure. That's why we came to this creepy amusement park in the first place.)
Caroline: (But how'd Brian get in the top car of a broken ferris wheel? Something weird is going on here…)
Robbie: "We gotta save him! But how do we get up there?"
Caroline: "Why not bring him down instead? The ferris wheel controls are nearby somewhere, I bet we could probably get the ferris wheel working again."
Yvette:"There's a staff entrance over here. I'll bet that's where the controls are."
Robbie: "Alright. Hold on Brian, we're going to rescue you!"
