Yvette: "Let me get the door." *SMASH*
Robbie: "Christopher! You ok?"
Christopher: "..."
Robbie: "Christopher? Wake up, come on."
(That's strange. I swear we heard him earlier. What's this shining ball of light anyways?)
Yvette: "Can we like, cover this light? It's hurting my eyes."
(As Yvette touched the light, it flashed brightly, blinding us momentarily. When our vision cleared, Christopher was wide awake.)
Christopher: "W-What happened? Robbie, is that you?"
Robbie: "Christopher! You're ok!"
Christopher: "Yeah I'm fine I'm fine. Get off me."
Yvette: "Enjoy your private ferris wheel ride?"
Christopher: "Huh? Ferris wheel? Where are we?" The last thing I remember was arriving here with everyone else. Speaking of which, where is everyone?"
Caroline: "We were hoping you knew that. By the way, what's the piece of paper you're holding onto?"
Christopher: "Huh? What is this?"
